# Object Detection API in Express using YOLOv5 exported model
This code is made using part of the code from [yolov5-tfjs](https://github.com/Hyuto/yolov5-tfjs). </br>
Very well done [Hyuto](https://github.com/Hyuto), your code really helps.

## This API if for a project to count strawberry flowers. 
A previous version was made using Flask in Python, you can see it [here](https://github.com/DavidSilTroy/python_API_Strawberry-flowers-recognition).

## How to use the API
### 1. Fisrt git clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/DavidSilTroy/python_API_Strawberry-flowers-recognition.git
```
### 2. Once it is downloaded, you have to go inside the folder and install the libraries:
```
npm install
```
or
```
yarn install
```
### 3. And now you can run it and test it in http://localhost:8080/ using:
```
npm start
```
#### Currently in http://localhost:8080/ you can request to:

- http://localhost:8080/drone-big-img/roboflow <-- receive full Drone image in base64 with x-www-urlencode 
- http://localhost:8080/drone-big-img/yolov5 <-- receive full Drone image in base64 with x-www-urlencode
- http://localhost:8080/drone-big-img <-- (redirects to the /drone-big-img/roboflow, so it's the same as before) 
- http://localhost:8080/phone-big-img <-- receive full Phone image in base64 with x-www-urlencode


### More about how to use it will come later!..
